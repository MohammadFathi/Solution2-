tweet_input directory is "C"   
tweet_output directory is "C"   
file tweets.txt is at ("C:\tweets.txt").  
files ft1.txt and ft2.txt will be created as ("C:\ft1.txt") and ("C:\ft2.txt").

We still can modify them easily in main_project.cpp at the top of this file at code lines as next:

#define tweet_input  "C"
#define tweet_output  "C"
